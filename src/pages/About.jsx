          "Impossible"- a word we come across so often that I decided to spend some time trying to understand the
          meaning. Dictionary says, "it is an unattainable task", then I looked closer and found my purpose "I'm
          possible". Suddenly it went from being an unattainable task to something that, on its own, is telling me that
          they are possible. This shift in perspective almost 16 years ago opened my realm. Whenever I come across this
          word subsequently, I have gone on to show the endless possibilities.

          I am a "learntrepreneur" at heart, and you are wondering what that means? I am someone who learns, shares,
          teaches, implements, and goes on to learn more. I am a serial entrepreneur with more than 15 years of
          experience as a Technology & Brand Strategy Professional. I believe in the core theme of Digital
          Transformation for the masses with emphasis on the base of pyramid consumers. I have eight years of experience
          working for multinationals like Unilever both in Bangladesh and Singapore. I have entrepreneurial ventures in
          the Development Sector, Fintech, Digital Solutions, Advertising and Research arena.

          I started my entrepreneurial journey in digital transformation with my family's renowned old
          multi-disciplinary management consulting business, Kranti Associates Ltd. Soon with my exposure to technology,
          I was able to see the opportunity to take a project, SoilSafe established in 1997, to a digital platform. We
          digitized and revolutionized "Soilsafe Soil Testing Minilab" by implementing an IOT based solution and an app
          to analyze the data and predict optimum fertilizer recommendations on the spot. For this innovation, we won
          the first-ever Asia Pacific ICT Award (APICTA) merit award for Bangladesh in the "Sustainability &
          Environmental Technology' category in 2016. The award is known as the Oscars of Asia Pacific ICT Arena. We
          also won Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) Agrow Award for "Best Use of Technology in Agriculture" in 2017.
          <br />
          <br />
          Following the success of this technology, I went to the development of MICROZEN – a fully integrated
          microfinance solution. LISTENYZEN – an artificially intelligent social listening software used by more than 50
          brands to manage their social media inquiry. COMMZEN – a conversation commerce bot solution that received the
          BASIS National ICT Award 2019.

          My professional and academic life revolves around Strategy and Digital Transformation. I believe that "Nothing
          is Impossible" with the right amount of zeal. Working towards digital transformation for the base of pyramid
          consumers can be a brilliant way of life!
